Welcome to our project repository for the ASAN Service Community Prediction Competition. 🌐

## Competition Overview 🏆

Növbə tutan vətəndaşın növbədən imtina etmə ehtimalını proqnozlaşdıra bilərsinizmi?

The competition tasked participants with predicting service cancellation instances during the first three months of 2020, leveraging historical data from 2018 and 2019. Find more about the competition [here](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/ai4digigov2021/data).

## Repository Structure 🗂️
